Name: Rock Paper Scissors

Description: 
- Create a JS console version of a 5 round game of Rock Paper Scissors.
- Practice functions (scope, return & helpers), conditionals and string methods.

Personal takeaway: 
let lesson = (readableness > ninjaCode) ? `Yes, but also be efficient` : `Learn to play with others`;
